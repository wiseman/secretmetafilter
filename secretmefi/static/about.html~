      <p>
        When you enter phrases in to the Metafilter, it displays a
        graph showing how frequently those phrases have occurred in
        the titles of Metafilter posts over the years.  You can select
        from four different
        corpora: <a href="http://metafilter.com">metafilter</a>, <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com">ask
        metafilter</a>, <a href="http://metatalk.metafilter.com">metatalk</a>
        and <a href="http://music.metafilter.com">music</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at a sample graph:
      </p>

      <img src="n-gram-example-1.png" alt="Chart screenshot">

      <p>
        This shows trends in three n-grams from 1999 to 2013: "I for
        one welcome" (a <i>4-gram</i>), "what it says on the tin"
        (a <i>6-gram</i>), and "slyt" (a <i>1-gram</i>
        or <i>unigram</i>).

        What the y-axis shows is this: of all the 4-grams seen in each
        year in titles of www.metafilter.com posts, what percentage of
        them are "I for one welcome"?  Of all the 3-grams in each
        year, what percentage of them are "what it says on the tin"?
        What percentage of unigrams are "slyt"?

        Here, you can see that the first time the phrase "I for one
        welcome" was used in a title was 2004 and peaked in 2010, that
        the last time "what it says on the tin" was clever is 2008,
        and that since 2010 the use of "slyt" in post titles has
        exploded.

      <a name="howmany"><h2>How big does <i>n</i> go?</h2></a>

      <p>
        The viewer can show 1-grams, 2-grams, 3-grams, 4-grams,
        5-grams and even 6-grams.
      </p>

      <a name="howpunct"><h2>How does the n-gram viewer handle punctuation?</h2></a>

      <p>
        The n-gram viewer does some "cooking" of text before
        processing it:

        <ul>
          <li>Punctuation is removed.</li>
          <li>Many contractions are expanded and possessives are
          removed (for example, "i'm" is treated "i am").</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
